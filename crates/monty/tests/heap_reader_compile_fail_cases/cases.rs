//! Compile-fail soundness tests for the `HeapReader` API.
//!
//! Each function here exercises a pattern that MUST be rejected by the borrow checker.
//! They are gated behind individual `cfg` flags so the integration test harness
//! (`tests/heap_reader_compile_fail.rs`) can compile each one independently and assert
//! that it fails with the expected error.
//!
//! These tests are never compiled during normal builds — only when the
//! `heap_reader_compile_fail_tests` cfg (plus a per-test cfg) is set.
