//! Versioned framing for serialized interpreter state.
//!
//! A dump is one postcard value — [`Dump`] — carrying both the interpreter
//! state and the session metadata a host must restore alongside it (script
//! name, type-check stubs), behind a `[MAGIC][DUMP_VERSION]` header. There is
//! exactly one dump shape, so hosts need no format knowledge beyond [`dump`]
//! and [`Dump::load`]; whether the session was idle or suspended is the
//! [`Session`] discriminant, not a separate tag.
