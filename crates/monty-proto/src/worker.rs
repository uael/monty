//! The transport-agnostic Monty protocol-child state machine.
//!
//! [`Child`] is the REPL session worker that both `monty subprocess` (native,
//! over stdio pipes) and the browser wasm worker (over `postMessage`) drive. It
//! consumes [`pb::ParentRequest`]s and emits [`pb::ChildEvent`]s through an
//! [`EventSink`], so the same turn logic serves any byte channel — the only
//! difference between transports is the sink and how requests are read.
//!
//! The child is strictly turn-based: one request in, zero or more streamed
//! `Print` events out, then exactly one turn-ending event (see `monty-proto`
//! for the schema and protocol rules).
//!
//! Crash isolation is the entire point: a host must treat a child that exits
//! (or EOFs) *without* a `FatalError` event as crashed — stack overflows and
//! allocator aborts produce no final frame. This crate has no opinion on how
//! the host transport surfaces that; it only ensures every *graceful* turn ends
//! with exactly one turn-ending event.
