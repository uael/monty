"""Check that the vendored typeshed tree matches what `update.py` would produce.

`build.rs` zips `vendor/typeshed/` into the binary and that zip is the only
thing the type checker ever sees, but nothing regenerates it automatically —
editing `custom/*.pyi`, `COPY_FILES`, `VERSIONS` or `COMMIT` has no effect
until `update.py` runs. Drift fails silently rather than loudly: a member the
stale stub does not describe is reported as `unresolved-attribute`, and a
module missing from `VERSIONS` is treated as not existing at all.

Everything except `builtins.pyi` (whose filtering needs the upstream clone) is
verified offline against the constants in `update.py`.
