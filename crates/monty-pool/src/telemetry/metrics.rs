//! Aggregate metrics for pool health and turn latency — what the spans in
//! [`tracing`](crate::telemetry::tracing) cannot answer: is the fleet
//! saturated, how often do workers die, how much sandbox time does a typical
//! run cost.
//!
//! Recorded for *every* checkout, not only those a host gave a
//! [`TelemetryContext`](crate::telemetry::TelemetryContext) to: an aggregate
//! covering only traced sessions would mislead. Rust hosts record into Logfire
//! instruments directly. A foreign adapter can instead receive each raw
//! measurement so its host metrics SDK controls aggregation.
//!
//! **No value the sandbox controls may become an attribute.** Every attribute
//! here is a closed set fixed by this crate, because one time series per value
//! is a way to exhaust a metrics backend — and a script can mint values freely
//! (calling `f_1()`, `f_2()`, … or raising a class per iteration). So a called
//! function's name is never recorded, not even when the host resolved it: a
//! host whose lookup is a callable resolves *any* name. Only the fixed os-call
//! names in [`os_call`] look like an exception, and they come from the
//! protocol's oneof rather than from the sandbox.
