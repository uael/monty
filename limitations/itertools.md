# `itertools` module

Monty implements a small subset of `itertools`. The implemented callables match
CPython 3.14 for arguments, values, `repr()` and error messages, apart from the
notes below.

## Implemented

`count(start=0, step=1)`, `repeat(object, times=?)`, `pairwise(iterable)`,
`compress(data, selectors)`, `islice(iterable, [start,] stop[, step])`,
`chain(*iterables)`, `cycle(iterable)`, `takewhile(predicate, iterable)`,
`dropwhile(predicate, iterable)`, `filterfalse(predicate, iterable)`,
`starmap(function, iterable)`, `accumulate(iterable, func=None, *, initial=None)`.

## Not implemented

Everything else: `batched`, `combinations`, `combinations_with_replacement`,
`groupby`, `permutations`, `product`, `tee`, `zip_longest`.

`chain.from_iterable` is also absent, even though `chain` itself is
implemented: it is a classmethod reached through an attribute on the `chain`
builtin, and Monty's module functions expose no attributes
(`itertools.chain.from_iterable` raises `AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method'
object has no attribute 'from_iterable'`). Use `chain(*iterables)` instead.

These names are absent from the module namespace rather than stubbed, so they
are rejected at type-check time (`Module 'itertools' has no member 'chain'`) and
raise `AttributeError` at runtime.

## `accumulate`

Matches CPython, including the parts that are easy to get wrong:

- The default operation is `+`, so it folds whatever `+` means for the values:
  `accumulate(['a', 'b'])` yields `'a'`, `'ab'`.
- **An explicit `None` is indistinguishable from an omitted argument**, for both
  `func` and `initial`, exactly as in CPython. `accumulate(xs, None)` adds, and
  `initial=None` means no initial value, so neither can be used to fold `None`
  in.
- With an `initial`, that value is yielded first untouched and the source is not
  advanced for it, so `accumulate([], initial=5)` yields `5` and an empty source
  with no initial yields nothing at all.
- `func` is called only when there is a second value to fold, so a non-callable
  `func` raises on the *second* `next()`, not at construction. The iterable, by
  contrast, is resolved eagerly and a non-iterable raises straight away.

## Behavioural divergences

- **`repeat.__length_hint__()` raises `AttributeError`.** CPython exposes the
  number of remaining yields through it (`repeat(9, 3).__length_hint__() == 3`).
  Monty uses the remaining count internally to size the target of `list()` /
  `tuple()`, but does not expose it as a Python-visible attribute.
- **`count` and `repeat` objects are unhashable.** `hash(itertools.count())`
  raises `TypeError: unhashable type: 'itertools.count'`, where CPython falls
  back to identity hashing. This applies to Monty's iterators generally, not
  just these two.
- **`count` accepts only `int`, `float` and `bool`.** CPython accepts anything
  satisfying `PyNumber_Check` (e.g. `Decimal`, `Fraction`, complex). Monty has
  no other numeric types, so the same `TypeError: a number is required` covers
  them all.
- **Nested-cycle `repr()` unwinds one level earlier.** For a container that
  reaches back to the `repeat` holding it, Monty prints `repeat([...])` where
  CPython prints `repeat([repeat([...])])`. This is Monty's general cycle
  detection in `repr()`, not specific to `itertools`.
- **Adaptors without a custom `repr()` omit the address.** `repr(pairwise([]))`
  is `<itertools.pairwise object>`, where CPython appends ` at 0x...`. This is
  Monty's general iterator treatment (see ./iter.md), not specific
  to `itertools`.
- **A callable that suspends is rejected, not paused.** `takewhile`,
  `dropwhile`, `filterfalse` and `starmap` apply their callable through the
  synchronous `evaluate_function` path, which runs a frame to completion and
  cannot yield to the host. A callable that reaches an external function, an
  `os` operation, or a host method call therefore raises
  `NotImplementedError: takewhile(): external function 'f' is not yet supported
  in this context` where CPython would simply call it. This is the same
  restriction that applies to `__init__`, `__next__` and `__repr__` (see
  `limitations/classes.md`); ordinary sandbox-defined functions and lambdas are
  unaffected.
- **Crossing the host boundary loses the repr.** A `count` / `repeat` object
  returned to the host arrives as `<itertools.count object>` /
  `<itertools.repeat object>` rather than its in-sandbox `repr()`
  (`count(0)`, `repeat(7, 3)`). Monty represents all iterators this way rather
  than recursing into what they hold.

## Infinite iterators and the eager builtins

`map()`, `filter()` and `enumerate()` are **eager** in Monty: each drains its
source into a list and returns a concrete result, rather than the lazy iterator
CPython returns. Applied to an infinite `itertools` iterator they therefore
never return, where CPython yields lazily:

```python
map(f, itertools.count())        # CPython: lazy. Monty: runs until a limit trips.
filter(p, itertools.repeat(1))   # likewise
enumerate(itertools.count())     # likewise
```

`zip()` stops at the shortest input, so `zip(itertools.count(), 'ab')` behaves
as in CPython, as does slicing an infinite iterator by hand via `next()`. This
is a pre-existing property of those builtins rather than something `itertools`
introduces, but `count()`/`repeat()` are the first easy way for sandboxed code
to reach it.

## Resource limits

`count()` and `repeat(x)` are infinite, so consuming one without a bound
(`list(itertools.count())`) only terminates if the host has configured a memory
or duration limit, and then raises `MemoryError` rather than exhausting. Under
`ResourceLimits::default()`, which sets neither (only a recursion depth), it
runs until the host itself runs out of memory. This is the same exposure as a
`while True:` loop, not something specific to `itertools`.

The adaptors that discard items without yielding — `dropwhile` and
`filterfalse` before their first accepted item, `compress` past a falsy run,
`islice` skipping to `start`, `chain` crossing an exhausted source — poll
`max_duration` themselves while looping, so a discarding pass over an infinite
source raises `TimeoutError` instead of spinning. The poll is amortized (once
per 64 items), so the limit can be overshot by up to that much work. CPython
has no duration limit at all and would loop forever.

`cycle(iterable)` must buffer every item it has seen so far in order to replay
them, and that buffer is charged against `max_memory` as it grows, so cycling
over a very long source raises `MemoryError` at the limit rather than at the
point the source is exhausted. CPython buffers the same items with no such
ceiling.

Nesting the source-driving adaptors (`pairwise`, `compress`, `islice`, `chain`,
`cycle`) is bounded by `max_recursion_depth`: each adaptor charges one recursion
level while delegating `next()` to its wrapped iterator, so a nest deeper than
the limit raises `RecursionError` when consumed. CPython imposes no comparable
per-adaptor bound; deep nesting there is limited only by the C stack.
