# Python language / parser

Monty parses Python source with Ruff's parser but rejects several constructs
at parse time. Anything listed below raises `NotImplementedError` (prefixed
with "The monty syntax parser does not yet support ") at compile time, before
any code runs.

## Statements rejected at parse time

- **`class` definitions** — simple classes are supported (instance methods,
  `__init__`/`__repr__`/`__str__`, class variables of arbitrary expressions).
  Rejected at parse time: base classes / metaclasses (`class Foo(Bar):`) and
  class-body statements other than `def`, a simple `name [: T] = <expr>`
  assignment, `type X = ...`, `pass`, or a docstring. There is no inheritance
  and no general dunder protocol. See ./classes.md.
- **`match` statements** — structural pattern matching is not supported.
- **`try*` / `except*` exception groups** — PEP 654 syntax rejected.
- **Async comprehensions** (`[x async for x in ...]`) — `async for` as a
  *statement* is supported; only the comprehension form is rejected.
- **`yield` inside a generator expression** — `SyntaxError: 'yield' inside
  generator expression`, as in CPython. Monty rejects it for the whole
  expression, including the outermost iterable (`(x for x in (yield))`), which
  CPython accepts.
- **Wildcard imports** (`from m import *`) — raises `ImportError:
  "Wildcard imports (\`from ... import *\`) are not supported"`.

## Expressions rejected at parse time

- **Complex number literals** (`1j`, `2+3j`) — `NotImplementedError: The monty
  syntax parser does not yet support complex constants`.

## Assignment and binding targets

Any assignable shape works on the left of `=`, as a `for`/`with` target, and as
an element of a tuple pattern: names, `obj.attr`, `d[k]`, nested patterns, and
one `*rest` per level. Divergences:

- **A starred target must be a plain name.** `a, *rest = xs` works;
  `a, *obj.rest = xs` and `a, *d['rest'] = xs` raise `SyntaxError: starred
  assignment target must be a name`. CPython accepts any target after `*`.
- **A comprehension target must be names only.** `[x for obj.a in xs]` and
  `[x for d['k'] in xs]` raise `NotImplementedError: The monty syntax parser
  does not yet support attribute or subscript targets in a comprehension`.
  CPython accepts both. Comprehension targets live in operand-stack slots,
  which have nowhere to store through an object.

## `del`

`del name`, `del obj.attr`, `del container[key]`, several targets in one
statement (`del a, d[k]`), and a parenthesized list (`del (a, b)`) all work,
deleting left to right. Divergences:

- **No slice deletion.** `del lst[1:3]` raises `TypeError: list indices must be
  integers or slices, not slice`, the same error `lst[1:3] = ...` raises, since
  Monty implements neither slice assignment nor slice deletion.
- **`del` reaches only real instance attributes.** `del obj.attr` works on an
  instance of a user class and raises `AttributeError` for every other type,
  including a `@dataclass` instance and the built-in types whose attributes are
  computed rather than stored. CPython allows deleting a dataclass instance
  attribute, and reports `attribute '<name>' is read-only` where Monty reports
  `has no attribute '<name>' and no __dict__ for setting new attributes`.
- **Module dunders cannot be deleted.** `del __name__` raises `NameError`,
  because the module dunders are resolved on read rather than stored (see
  below). CPython deletes the real module-dict entry.

## PEP 695 type parameters and type aliases

`def f[T](x): ...`, `class C[T]: ...` and `type X[T] = ...` all parse, and the
`type` statement binds a real `TypeAliasType` object. See ./typing.md for what
the type parameters do (and do not) mean at runtime.

## Template strings (PEP 750)

`t'...'` builds a `string.templatelib.Template`. See ./string_templatelib.md.

## Starred unpacking

Anything Monty can iterate may follow a `*`, matching CPython: `[*xs]`,
`(*xs,)`, `{*xs}`, `f(*xs)`, `a, b = xs` and `a, *b = xs` all accept whatever
`list(xs)` accepts.

One message divergence: passing a non-iterable to a call, `f(*1)`, reports
`TypeError: Value after * must be an iterable, not int`, the same wording as a
list literal. CPython instead names the callable by its module-qualified
`__qualname__`: `__main__.f() argument after * must be an iterable, not int`,
and correspondingly `__main__.C.m()`, `__main__.<lambda>()` or
`__main__.outer.<locals>.inner()`. Monty has neither function `__qualname__`
nor module-qualified names (see the class-name note in ./collections.md), so
it reports the generic form. Every other unpacking form matches CPython
exactly.

## `return` at module level

CPython rejects a `return` outside a function at compile time
(`SyntaxError: 'return' outside function`). Monty runs it: the module body
returns, ending the snippet there with that value, and the host is told a
`return` is what ended it rather than the body running out of statements
(`MontyComplete.returned` in the Python bindings, `Complete.returned` on the
wire). A trailing expression still supplies the snippet's value, but claims no
`return`.

This exists for hosts that feed a session in chunks and want a chunk to be able
to close itself: without it, the only way to hand a value out of a module body
is to rewrite the source's AST and smuggle the value through an exception.
Nothing else about `return` changes; inside a function it is CPython's.

## Source nesting depth

- AST nesting is capped at 200 levels (30 in debug builds); exceeding it raises `SyntaxError: Source is too deeply nested`.
- The budget is shared across every nesting-producing construct (parens, calls, subscripts, attribute chains, operators, comprehensions, control-flow blocks, `with`, etc.), including the synthetic nesting from a flat multi-item `with`; see ./with.md.
- The message differs from CPython, which uses construct-specific wording (`too many nested parentheses`, `too many statically nested blocks`, …).
- Class-body annotations count against the budget even though they are stringized rather than evaluated (see ./typing.md), as do class-variable values and method parameter defaults; all three are walked before being parsed. CPython imposes no comparable limit on a stringized annotation.

## Imports

- Only the bundled stdlib modules listed in ./modules.md can be
  imported. Importing anything else raises `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Relative imports (`from . import x`) raise `ImportError: "attempted
  relative import with no known parent package"`; there is no package
  system.
- `__import__` is not defined.

## `__future__` imports

`from __future__ import ...` is a compiler directive, not a real import: it
binds nothing and is accepted as a no-op. Of CPython's ten features, eight
became mandatory in Python 3.7 or earlier and so are inert there too, and
`annotations` is a no-op here because Monty already stringizes annotations
(see ./typing.md). Divergences:

- **`barry_as_FLUFL`** (PEP 401) raises `NotImplementedError: "The monty
  syntax parser does not yet support the 'barry_as_FLUFL' future feature"`.
  CPython accepts it, making `<>` the inequality operator and `!=` a
  `SyntaxError`; Monty parses neither differently, so the import is rejected
  rather than silently ignored.
- **Aliasing is rejected.** `from __future__ import annotations as ann` raises
  `NotImplementedError: "The monty syntax parser does not yet support aliasing
  a \`__future__\` feature"`. CPython binds `ann` to a `__future__._Feature`
  object; a no-op would bind nothing and surface as a `NameError` far from the
  import, so it is rejected at the import instead.
- **Position is not enforced.** CPython requires `__future__` imports to
  precede all other statements (`SyntaxError: "from __future__ imports must
  occur at the beginning of the file"`); Monty accepts them anywhere.
- `import __future__` (as opposed to `from __future__ import ...`) raises
  `ModuleNotFoundError`; there is no `__future__` module object.

## Module-level dunder variables

Monty has no module object and no `globals()` dict, but it exposes a fixed set
of module-level dunders so common idioms (e.g. `if __name__ == '__main__':`)
work. They are resolved on read; there is no real namespace entry behind them.

| Name              | Monty value  | CPython (script run)         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `__name__`        | `'__main__'` | `'__main__'`                 |
| `__debug__`       | `True`       | `True`                       |
| `__doc__`         | `None`       | `None` or docstring `str`    |
| `__spec__`        | `None`       | `None`                       |
| `__package__`     | `None`       | `None`                       |
| `__annotations__` | empty `dict` | `NameError` (no annotations) |

In Monty `__doc__` is always `None`, since module docstrings are never
extracted, and `__annotations__` is always an empty `dict` because
module-level annotations are not stored (see ./typing.md); CPython 3.14
instead raises `NameError` when a module has no annotations (PEP 649).

These names are **read-only**: assigning one at module or global scope (including
via `global __name__` inside a function, and augmented assignment like
`__name__ += ...`) is rejected at compile time with
`NotImplementedError: cannot reassign read-only module attribute '<name>'`.
CPython instead *allows* rebinding most of them (it is how you set a module
docstring), and rejects only `__debug__`, with a `SyntaxError`.

Binding one of these names as a **function local** is allowed (it is an
ordinary local in a separate namespace), matching CPython, except `__debug__`,
which CPython rejects everywhere with `SyntaxError` but Monty permits as a
local.

Other module dunders CPython defines (`__loader__`, `__file__`, `__builtins__`,
`__cached__`, `__dict__`) are not exposed; reading them falls through to the host
name lookup and ultimately raises `NameError` if unresolved. `__loader__` is
omitted because CPython always binds it to a loader *object* (never `None`), so
exposing `None` would diverge on type, and a real loader is neither available
nor safe to surface in the sandbox. `__file__` is omitted so no host path can
leak into the sandbox.

## Function objects

A function exposes **no** attributes: `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__qualname__` and
`__module__` all raise `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute
'<name>'`, and new ones cannot be set — `fn.tag = True` raises `AttributeError:
'function' object has no attribute 'tag' and no __dict__ for setting new
attributes`. CPython supports all of these.

This bounds what a decorator can do: it can call, wrap, store or replace the
function it receives, but cannot ask the function about itself, so
`functools.wraps`-style metadata copying, registries keyed by `fn.__name__`, and
attribute tagging for later discovery all have no equivalent.

## Ordering comparisons

`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` on operands with no defined ordering raise
`TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of '{a}' and '{b}'`, matching
CPython (int vs str, `None` vs `None`, user-class instances without comparison
dunders, etc.). Lists and tuples order lexicographically as in CPython. A `NaN`
operand is *unordered* rather than incomparable, so `float('nan') < 1` (and
every operator/direction, including two NaNs) returns `False` without raising,
also matching CPython, and likewise inside `sorted`/`min`/`max`.

One message divergence: when a **list or tuple** compares unequal only because
an *inner element* pair is unorderable (e.g. `(1, 2) < (1, 'a')`), Monty names
the outer container types (`'tuple' and 'tuple'`) where CPython names the inner
element pair (`'int' and 'str'`). Both raise `TypeError`; only the message text
differs.

One value divergence: whenever CPython compares elements *inside* a container it
shortcuts equality by **object identity** (`x is x` ⇒ equal) before falling back
to `==`. Monty has no object identity for immediate floats, so it asks `==`, and
a `NaN` is never equal to itself. Every container operation built on element
comparison therefore differs when the *same* `NaN` object appears on both sides:

| with `x = float('nan')` | CPython | Monty |
|---|---|---|
| `(x,) == (x,)`, `[x] == [x]` | `True` | `False` |
| `x in [x]` | `True` | `False` |
| `[x].count(x)` | `1` | `0` |
| `[x].index(x)` | `0` | `ValueError` |
| `[1, x] < [1, x, 3]` | `True` | `False` |

`NaN` is the only practical way to reach this, being the one built-in value
unequal to itself. *Distinct* `NaN` objects agree on both
(`[1, float('nan')] < [1, float('nan'), 3]` is `False` either way), as does a
direct `x == x` (`False` on both). Named tuples inherit all of this from `tuple`.

## What *does* work

- Functions (`def`, `async def`), nested functions, closures, and decorators on
  them, on classes, and on methods.
- `del` statements, and attribute / subscript targets in assignments,
  `for` targets and `with` targets (see above).
- PEP 695 `type X = ...` aliases and type parameters on `def`/`class`.
- PEP 750 template strings (`t'...'`).
- List / dict / set comprehensions, and lazy generator expressions.
- Generator functions (`yield`, `yield from`, `send`/`throw`/`close`),
  `async for`, `async with`, and async generators. See ./iter.md and
  ./asyncio.md for their divergences.
- `try` / `except` / `else` / `finally`, `raise ... from ...`.
- `for` / `while` / `if` / `elif` / `else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`,
  `assert`, `global`, `nonlocal`, `return`.
- `import x`, `import x.y`, `from x import y, z as w`.
- f-strings including `=` debug specifier, `!r`/`!s`/`!a` conversions, and
  format specs.
